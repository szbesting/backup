# Usage

1. direct usage(run in Windows via simulation)

    Install VS(2008+, express edition should be OK), run scons on the root
    directory of this project. There will be two executeables in the folder
    executeables/. One is demo.exe, the other is realtouch.exe. After copying
    SDL.dll from win32/SDL/lib to executeables/, you are ready to run the
    programs above.

2. use it in RT-Thread

    Because RT-Thread has removed RTGUI component. You have to copy
    `components/rtgui` to the `components` folder. If you need demo, you should
    copy all the files in `demo/examples` to the examples/gui folder under RTT.
    Don't forget to re-run scons.
